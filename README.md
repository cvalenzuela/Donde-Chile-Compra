# Where does Chile Buys?

Visualizing all Chilean Government Purchases: Who, what and where it buys?

Chile has a government purchasing system called “Convenio Marco”. This system seeks to generate savings in the management so that those goods that appear in a digital catalog, which have already been awarded in a tender, should not be tendered again whenever a public entity requires it, but are purchased easily and directly through the catalog.

In this catalog, there are also specific categories to classify the goods offered. This visualization aims to explore where do most companies that sell to the Chilean Government came from and what type of things do they sell.
